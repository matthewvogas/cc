          Consistency with Applicable Laws: This Privacy Policy is intended to
          comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which
          Codecoco operates. In the event that any provision of this Privacy
          Policy conflicts with the laws of your jurisdiction, the relevant laws
          of your jurisdiction shall prevail to the extent required.

        <h1 className='text-2xl'>SEVERABILITY.</h1>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Privacy Policy is found to be invalid,
          illegal, or unenforceable under any applicable law or court decision,
          the remaining provisions of this Privacy Policy shall remain in full
          force and effect. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
          shall be deemed severed from this Privacy Policy to the extent of its
          invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, and the rest of the
          Privacy Policy shall continue in effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of such a severance, the parties shall make good faith
          efforts to replace the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
          with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that reflects the
          original intent of the parties to the maximum extent possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision in
          any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity, legality, or
          enforceability of that provision in any other jurisdiction.
